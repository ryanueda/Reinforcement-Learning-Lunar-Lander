Reinforcement Learning For OpenAI's Lunar Lander

## About OpenAI's Lunar Lander
OpenAI Lunar Lander is a reinforcement learning environment that simulates the classic arcade game of landing a spacecraft on the surface of the moon. In this environment, an agent (e.g. a machine learning algorithm) is trained to control the spacecraft and make decisions about when to apply thrust and how much to apply in order to safely land the spacecraft. The agent receives rewards for successfully landing the spacecraft and penalties for crashing or using too much fuel. Through trial and error, the agent learns to optimize its actions in order to maximize the rewards it receives. This type of problem is well-suited for reinforcement learning, as the agent must learn to adapt its actions based on the consequences of those actions.
